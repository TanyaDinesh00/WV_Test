Show how to use flutters geolocator plugin in the webview plugin

## Getting Started

The WebViewGeolocator widget is a drop in replacement for flutters webview.  
It redirects calls on navigator.geolocation JS api to the geolocator plugin.  
This way the webview won't show a alert dialog asking for location permissions.
